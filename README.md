**NestedDecayTrees.jl** is a Julia package designed to simplify the calculation of angular observables and transformations for decay processes. The package provides a tree object stored in memory as a nested structure with templated info field for each node. The tree represent decay chains and facilitates the extraction and manipulation of angular information at each node. The design is flexible and efficient, enabling the computation of complex decay observables using recursive tree traversal and parent-child relationships between nodes.

> [!WARNING]
> More user-friendly representation of the multi-column trees is found with the table-compatible interface.
> Development will move towards [`DecayTreeDataFrames.jl`](https://github.com/mmikhasenko/DecayTreeDataFrames.jl), archiving this package.


## Features

- **Tree Representation of Decay Chains**: Represents decay chains as hierarchical tree structures, where each node holds the decay parameters and observables.
- **Recursive Traversal**: Allows recursive operations on the tree, providing access to both the parent and child nodes during calculations.
- **Table Interface**: values stored at the node are easy to convert into Table.

## Installation

This package depends on `FourVectors.jl`, which is an unregistered package from GitHub:

- **If `Manifest.toml` is present** (as in this repository): The unregistered package will be automatically installed when you add `NestedDecayTrees.jl` to your environment, as the manifest includes the exact dependency information.
  ```julia
  using Pkg
  Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/mmikhasenko/NestedDecayTrees.jl.git")
  ```

- **If using a different setup without the manifest**: You need to manually install `FourVectors.jl` before adding `NestedDecayTrees.jl`:
  ```julia
  using Pkg
  Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/mmikhasenko/FourVectors.jl.git")
  Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/mmikhasenko/NestedDecayTrees.jl.git")
  ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To start using **NestedDecayTrees.jl**, you can create a tree structure to represent a decay chain and then perform operations on each node in the tree.

```julia
using NestedDecayTrees

# Define a decay topology as a nested tuple structure
topology = (1, (2, 3))
```

To construct a decay tree from a tuple, one calls a `DecayNode` of the topology.
```julia
dn = DecayNode(topology)
```
It returns a `DecayNode` which children are `DecayNote`s as well.

#### Computing decay angles

To compute angles for an arbitrary decay topology, one needs:
1. create a topolory
2. add information to each node, either it is a particle-1 or particle-2, since the tranformations for these are different.
3. The method `add_transform_through` create a transformation based on the passed type, `HelicityTransformation` and apply to particles from parents to children.

The line that do that are:
```julia
labeled_topology = (1, (2, 3))
momenta_dict = Dict(four_momenta_gj)
#
tree_empty = DecayNode(labeled_topology);
tree_with_particle_order = add_indices_order(tree_empty);
tree_with_four_vectors = add_transform_through(HelicityTransformation, tree_with_particle_order, momenta_dict);
```

#### Mapping over the Tree

The `map_tree` function allows you to apply an operation to each node in the tree. Here, we create a representation of each node by converting its value to a string.

```julia
name_repr = map_tree(dn) do value, node
    tuple_representation = value
    (; name=string(value), tuple_representation)
end
```

After this operation, `name_repr` is a new tree where each node contains a `NamedTuple` with a `name` (a string representation of the original node’s value) and a `tuple_representation`.


## Internals

### Key methods for tree manipulation

- **`map_tree`**: Traverses the tree and applies a function to each node, generating a new tree with transformed node values.
- **`map_with_parent`**: Similar to `map_tree`, but provides access to the parent’s value, allowing calculations that depend on both the parent and child nodes.

This setup allows you to represent decay chains as trees, traverse and manipulate them flexibly, and perform calculations at each node or across parent-child relationships.

### Mapping with Parent Information

Using `map_with_parent`, you can apply a function that has access to both the current node and its parent’s value, which can be useful for calculations that depend on the hierarchical structure of the decay chain.

```julia
with_parent = map_with_parent(dn, "X") do value, parent_value
    string(parent_value) * " => " * string(value)
end
```

In this example, each node in `with_parent` contains a string showing the path from the root node to the current node in the form of `"parent => child"`. For the root node, the initial `parent_value` is set to `"X"`, which you can customize.
